Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containerization.
Containerization: Docker enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight containers. Containers encapsulate everything needed to run an application, including code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.
The Docker Engine runs on the host operating system and manages containers.
Containers are isolated environments that run applications and their dependencies. 

Docker Toolbox: Legacy solution for running Docker on older Windows and macOS systems.
Docker Desktop: Official Docker solution for running Docker on modern Windows and macOS systems.
Docker Quickstart: Deprecated script for setting up Docker Toolbox on Windows and macOS.
